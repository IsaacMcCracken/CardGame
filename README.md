### Style Guide
  To under stand the style of the code base,
  please read intro.c located in the main 
  directory.

### Game Design*
  The game is a turnbased combat strategy game on a grid 
  where you will have a party of 3 characters* 

  Each turn we the player can move a certain distance based
  on the characters movement speed and bonuses given by cards

  They can use a primary action such as casting spells, attacking 
  with weapons using cards.

  They can also do a bonus action such as being able to cover more 
  movement and using items.
  
  I think thats all for now.

  \* this means that the team might change the idea of the 
  game as we continue to collaberate to new ideas
