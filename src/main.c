// Ok I have this idea to combine a card game with a 
// turn based strategy game I think the idea would be 
// kinda interesting

// Supporters would be like spirits that you can call on 
// and items would be physical items that you throw on the grid

// we could have emergent game play like throwing a flamable liquid 
// on the ground then lighting it on fire would cause the whole area to 
// light up

// we could possibly save on art assets by having a paper mario kinda animation 
// thing going on. 

// Rules each player controls three characters 
// == Card Types == 
// Item Cards
// - weapons - each character can hold one weapon at a time
